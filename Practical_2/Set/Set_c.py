# c. Write a Python program to create an intersection, Union, difference of sets.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# creating 2 sample sets
set1 = {3, 2, 5, 12, 8}
set2 = {1, 8, 5, 7, 17}

# printing both the sets
print(set1)
print(set2)

# finding the intersection of both sets
print('Intersection:', set1.intersection(set2))

# finding the union of both sets
print('Union:', set1.union(set2))

# finding the difference of both sets
print('Difference:', set1.difference(set2))
